# One Meaning At A time




Experimental niche publishing platform where the editor selects one
and exactly only one meant definition for any number of words, making
such selection salient to readers upon hovering draggable cursors or
tapping onto the term.

## What prompted this idea ?

In studying the portuguese language, such a highly contextual
language, one might benefit from a coherent way to fashion text whose
word definitions are as non-confusing as possible.



## Technical Aspects

Each word anchored in its definition SHALL carry within itself one
semantic value. This aspect MAY provide a sort of azimuth,
figuratively speaking, into a set of publications so that every word
carrying one meaning is at the disposal of readers.

One might choose to think of the above aspect in, analogous terms, as
every single meant definition being a mitochondria **and** a word carrying
said meaning being a "type" of eukaryotic organism.
