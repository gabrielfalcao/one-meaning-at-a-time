# One Meaning At A time (OMAAT)




Experimental niche publishing platform where the editor selects one
and exactly only one meant definition for any number of words, making
such selection salient to readers upon hovering draggable cursors or
tapping onto the term.

## What prompted this idea ?

In studying the portuguese language, such a highly contextual
language, one might benefit from a coherent way to fashion text whose
word definitions are as non-confusing as possible.


## Abstraction

Each word anchored in its definition SHALL carry within itself one
semantic value. This aspect MAY provide a sort of azimuth,
figuratively speaking, into a set of publications so that every word
carrying one meaning is at the disposal of readers.

One might choose to think of the above aspect in, analogous terms, as
every single meant definition being a mitochondria **and** a word
carrying said definition being the one eukaryote cell surrounding it
because the mitochondria, being perceived not uncommonly as a cell's
powerhouse, having one and exactly one meaning to concern oneself
about, the reader of an OMAAT-powered publication benefits in terms of
not only a less onerous metabolic cost in one's cognitive processes
since such cost is amortized by the writer's own coginitive processes.


## Technical Aspects

The semantical metadata MIGHT be stored within an instance of the
Virtuoso Open Source server or structured in RDF format and stored in
a database system that is reasonably valid for the purposes of not
uneasily querying words and definitions.
