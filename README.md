# One Meaning At A time (OMAAT)




Experimental niche publishing platform where the editor selects one
and exactly only one meant definition for any number of words, making
such selection salient to readers upon hovering draggable cursors or
tapping onto the term.

## What prompted this idea ?

In studying the portuguese language, such a highly contextual
language, one might benefit from a coherent way to fashion text whose
word definitions are as non-confusing as possible.


## Abstraction

Each word anchored in its definition SHALL carry within itself one
semantic value. This aspect MAY provide a sort of azimuth,
figuratively speaking, into a set of publications so that every word
carrying one meaning is at the disposal of readers.

One might choose to think of the above aspect in, analogous terms, as
every single meant definition being a mitochondria **and** a word
carrying said definition being the one eukaryote cell surrounding it
because the mitochondria, being perceived not uncommonly as a cell's
powerhouse, having one and exactly one meaning to concern oneself
about, the reader of an OMAAT-powered publication benefits in terms of
not only a less onerous metabolic cost in one's cognitive processes
since such cost is amortized by the writer's own coginitive processes.


## Technical Aspects

The semantical metadata MIGHT be stored within an instance of the
[Virtuoso Open Source](https://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS#Functionality%20Realms) server or structured in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) format and stored in
a database system that is reasonably valid for the purposes of not
uneasily querying words and definitions.


## REMARKS

- It appears that, in forming one's individual lexicon and considering
  two distinct languages, one might occasionaly assume, in not at all
  invstigating the proper meanings in valid dictionaries of both
  languages, that certain words whose ortography display certain
  patterns which not uncommonly point to equivalent linguistic
  elements could, in fact, permit the noninvestigated translation of such words.
  - Considering, for example, the English and Portuguese languages
    whence the suffixes "-bly" and "-mente", respectively, occasionaly
    appear to indicate the transformation of an adjective into an
    adverb.
    - Yet as an example the english word "ostensibly" and the
      portuguese word "ostensivamente" might intuitively seem,
      erroneously, to have the same meaning, but appear to have quite different meanings.
  - One quite critical example of such nondesirable misunderstanding
    is that of the english word "paradox" and the portuguese word
    "paradoxo" whose meanings appear to be entirely different.
